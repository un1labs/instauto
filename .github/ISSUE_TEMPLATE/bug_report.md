**To Reproduce**
Share your setting and describe what the bot is doing before you receive the error

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: [e.g. iOS]
 - Browser [e.g. chrome, safari]
 - Version [e.g. 22]

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

**Provide me with HTML**

Did you receive an error while the bot is running?

To make it easier for me to understand why it's failing, please copy and share with me the HTML of the button (or even better the whole page) and share it, by following these instructions:

- Make sure you run the command after getting the error message
- make sure that you open the dev tools **on the correct window (the instagram page)**

Use <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> (on macOS), or <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> (on Windows/Linux) to open devtools.

Using the Web Inspector (F12), go to the Elements tab, right click on the tag in your code and select Copy->Copy outerHTML. Then paste that here

If you feel it's private information you can instead email to simpleinstabot@yankee.no
